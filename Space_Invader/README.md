# Space_Invader
2D Game "Old memories"

This game is based on 2d old games like super mario but its an copy of space invader as a begineer programmer.
I've created this game watching some tutorials and codes and this game was written in Python version 3.
Using Pygame, Math, Random, Time module
You can directly donwload Game file based on your system or can copy the code manually and create your own game using your ideas.
